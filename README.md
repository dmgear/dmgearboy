# Game Boy Color Emulator

Hello! I'm Dylan Gearhart, and I would like to introduce my latest project: a **Game Boy Color Emulator**. The goal of this project is to emulate the Game Boy Color's hardware and provide a platform to run Game Boy Color ROMs. I expect this will be a fun and challenging way for me to dive deep into low-level programming.

## About the Project

### Project Goals:
- Replicating the Game Boy Color's CPU and memory architecture
- Implementing basic graphics rendering
- Enabling Game Boy Color input system support
- Creating a smooth experience for running and playing Game Boy Color ROMs

## Features

- Game Boy Color CPU and memory emulation
- Graphics rendering using SDL2
- Input handling 
- Sound emulation
- Ability to load and run Game Boy Color ROMs
