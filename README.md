# Dylan Gearhart's Game Boy Color Emulator

Hello! I'm Dylan Gearhart, and I'm excited to introduce my latest project: a **Game Boy Color Emulator**. This is an ongoing project that I'm undertaking as part of my exploration into emulator development and systems programming. The goal of this project is to emulate the Game Boy Color's hardware and provide a platform to run Game Boy Color ROMs.

## About the Project

This project aims to simulate the core functionalities of the Game Boy Color, including the CPU, memory, graphics, and input systems. It's a fun and challenging way for me to dive deep into low-level programming.

### Project Goals:
- Replicating the Game Boy Color's CPU and memory architecture
- Implementing basic graphics rendering
- Enabling Game Boy Color input system support
- Creating a smooth experience for running and playing Game Boy Color ROMs

## Features

- Game Boy Color CPU and memory emulation
- Basic graphics rendering using SDL2
- Game Boy Color input handling (buttons, d-pad)
- Initial sound emulation
- Ability to load and run Game Boy Color ROMs
